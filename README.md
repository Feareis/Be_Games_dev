## About the project -

In my spare time, I play a variety of games and spend part of my time to fill my evenings.

### Redstart Helper -

Overall, the programme can be used to illustrate various problems with fiveM players in an ".exe" file.
In particular, it lets you install FiveM, set up your discord so that you can access the platform's various whitelist servers and solve your connection problems.
